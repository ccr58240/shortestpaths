Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the size of an image is reduced by one pixel in height (by removing a horizontal seam) or width (by removing a vertical seam) at a time. Unlike cropping pixels from the edges or scaling the entire image, seam carving attempts to identify and preserve the most important content in an image.
